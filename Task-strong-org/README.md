1. [Sample layout is located on Figma.com](https://www.figma.com/file/FmkjniLQtJaeZcZhEHEPzQex/Agnecy-Landing-Page_Main-File?node-id=0%3A1)
2. Make layout on flexbox. Consider, how many containers will needed. Too many
wrappers is worthy: it will make it difficult to work with the code. Applying
all properties to one wrapper may not be the best solution. Try to keep a
balance.
3. Use semantic tags smartly.
4. Grab social media icons from the web and insert them using a suitable HTML
elements. Arrange the content as in the layout. You don't need to push the
`footer` to the bottom of the page.
5. Bonus: lay out the `footer` so that it is pressed to the bottom of the page
:wink:
6. Make the entire layout responsive using `breakpoints`. Elements should wrap
and resize based on the width of the `viewport` to fit optimally on the screen.
Apply media queries so that at any screen width (350 pixels minimum), the
content of the modified layout falls into the `viewport` and at the same time is
the maximum possible size. The content should take up free space and still wrap
to a new line so as not to be too narrow.
7. Interactive forms can be laid out as blocks with a background color and text
content inside.
